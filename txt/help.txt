CA  - it runs the change all

01  - it runs the predefined checks

02  - it runs the custom checks.
      The custom checks file must be included by you in the cmd folder. Don't insert lt all. Load the MOs with lt by specifying them with all the necessary capital letters where needed
      Example:
      lt PlugInUnit
      lt AuxPlugInUnit
      lt FieldReplaceableUnit
      get Equipment=1,FieldReplaceableUnit .
      get Equipment=1,AuxPlugInUnit .
      get Slot=.,PlugInUnit .

03  - it runs the prefefined checks + your custom checks.
      The custom checks file must be included by you in the cmd folder. Don't insert lt all. Load the MOs with lt by specifying them with all the necessary capital letters where needed
      Example:
      lt PlugInUnit
      lt AuxPlugInUnit
      lt FieldReplaceableUnit
      get Equipment=1,FieldReplaceableUnit .
      get Equipment=1,AuxPlugInUnit .
      get Slot=.,PlugInUnit .
